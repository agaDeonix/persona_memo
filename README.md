# PersonaMemo (WIP)

## Introduction

PersonaMemo is a mobile application designed to help users document their relationships with the people in their lives. By keeping track of the positive and negative aspects of each person, along with their best and worst moments, users can gain a better understanding of their relationships and maintain a personal archive of these experiences.

## Features

1. **Add Contacts:** Easily add new contacts to your app and categorize them by relationship type (e.g. family, friends, colleagues).

2. **Positive and Negative Traits:** Record the positive and negative characteristics of each contact, which can be updated and edited as your relationship evolves.

3. **Best and Worst Moments:** Document memorable moments in your relationships, both good and bad, along with the date and a short description.

4. **Search and Filter:** Quickly search for a specific person or filter by relationship type, allowing you to easily access the information you need.

5. **Backup and Security:** Secure your data with password protection and backup your notes to the cloud to ensure their safety and accessibility.
